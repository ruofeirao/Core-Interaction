    <h2>What is UV, and why is it important?</h2>

    <p id="para1"> 
        The UV Index is a numbered value that corresponds to the intensity 
        of UV (ultraviolet) radiation from the sun. Although exposure to sunlight 
        is often enjoyable, too much of it can be extremely harmful to your body.
    </p>
    <p id="para1.5"> 
        When your skin is
        exposed to UV rays for an excessive amount of time, the DNA
        of your skin cells become damaged, and skin cancer can start when this 
        damage is serious enough to affect skin cell growth.
        <!-- Although UV rays make up only a very small portion of the sun’s rays, 
        they are the main cause of the sun’s damaging effects on the skin. -->
    </p>
    <p id="para2">
        No matter what your age or skin type is, it is important to always
        stay protected from overexposure to the sun since the 
        sun's UV radiation poses serious risks of immediate visible damages 
        such as sunburn, as well as the above-mentioned long-term effects 
        of skin cancer.
    </p>
    <p id="para3">
        Do not be tricked into thinking that you are safe from harm when
        the weather appears to be cloudy or rainy. 
        Up to 80% of the sun's UV rays can still pass through clouds, and this is 
        often the reason why many end up getting serious sunburns 
        on 'harmless' overcast days if they've 
        spent time outdoors with a lack of protection.
        </p>

        Match your UV Index to the 
        color-coded table below, and follow the recommended steps to 
        maximize your protection from the harmful effects of UV radiation.
