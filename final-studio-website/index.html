    <h2>What is UV, and why is it important?</h2>

    <p id="para1"> 
        The UV Index is a numbered value that corresponds to the intensity 
        of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Some exposure to sunlight 
        is enjoyable. However, too much sun can be dangerous. 
    </p>
    <p id="para1.5"> 
        Even though UV rays 
        make up only a very small portion of the sun’s rays, 
        they are the main cause of the sun’s damaging effects on the skin.
    </p>
    <p id="para2">
        People of all ages 
        and skin types need 
        to be protected from overexposure to the sun as overexposure to the 
        sun's UV radiation poses serious risks of immediate health effects 
        such as sunburn as well as long-term effects such as skin cancer.
    </p>
    <p id="para3">
        Do not be fooled by cloudy, rainy, or cold weather. Up to 80% of the 
        sun's UV rays can pass through clouds, and this is the reason why people 
        often end up with serious sunburns if they've spent time outside 
        with no UV protection on 'harmless' overcast days.
        </p>
    <p id="para4">
        Match your UV Index to the 
        color-coded table below, and follow the recommended steps to 
        maximize your protection from UV rays.
